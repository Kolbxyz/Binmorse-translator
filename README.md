# Morse and binary translator

This is a python program that can translate (almost) anything from morse to alphanumeric, alphanumeric to morse, binary to alphanumeric and alphanumeric to binary.

## Calculator version

There is also a *calculator version* that works fine with a TI-83 with python (it may work with other calculators but I did not try).
If you want to install this program on your calculator (why  would you?), you must install TI Connect CE [https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/CA9C74CAD02440A69FDC7189D7E1B6C2/swticonnectcesoftware],
plug your calculator in your computer and drop the python file in it and, here you go! You're all done! Once you finished the installation, click on (on your calculator) "prgm", "Python app" then select the file!
